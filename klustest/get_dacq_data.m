function mtint = get_dacq_data(config,snames,tetrodes)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	This is a wrapper function for loading of Axona data sets. It aims to create a giant 
%   structure file full of all the session data
%   mtint = getDACQDATA(cname,snames,tetrodes);
%
%%%%%%%% Inputs
%   cname = this is the name of the output of merging the sessions, i.e. 'kwiktint'
%   snames = the different filenames used to generate the .cut file
%   tetrodes = the tetrodes requested
%
%%%%%%%% Outputs
%   mtint = the structure array of information (details below)
%
%%%%%%%% Comments
%   05/08/16 created from readAllDACQdata
%   06/08/16 added exporting of waveforms for plotting
%   06/08/16 fixed issues with concatenated sessions
%   08/08/16 added use of concatenated filename
%   19/08/16 fixed problem with name, added _multi
%   25/08/16 added tetrodes input, otherwise these functions want to run on all tetrode files, which can be a problem if one is corrupted or not wanted etc
%   26/08/16 changed to getDACQDATA to resolve any ambiguity
%   26/08/16 function now only handles one input file - I will never want to combine files that were not clustered together, I don't see why anyone else would/should either
%   01/09/16 added digital inputs to mtint
%   10/09/16 added LFP to mtint
%   20/09/16 function will now get spike times from the last column of .fet files if they exist (this is faster than reading spike files)
%   21/09/16 added progress counter to spike loading
%   01/11/16 reduced mtint size by converting most things to single, or uint where possible, mtint should now be about 50mB instead of gigabytes
%   10/04/17 added warning for when the .cut file is not found 
%       13/04/16 changed this to an error as it tends to mess everything up when this is the case
%   13/04/17 added an error message for when the .cut file doesnt match the parent filenames
%   07/06/17 fixed error where the function always tries to use all tetrodes (added tetrodes as an input)
%   24/07/17 added compatibility with variable pixel ratio. now using getDACQDATA instead of key_value, also cleaned up headers
